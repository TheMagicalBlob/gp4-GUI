# GP4 GUI
Legal gengp4.exe alternative written in C# made to avoid dealing with some of the more infuriating
aspects of gengp4.exe, like writing to param.sfo, or building useless gp4's if the folder name isn't
formatted perfectly _(TITLEID-category)._

This is the GUI version of the currently unnamed Open Source GP4 Blah blah blah I'm making a cmd line version and a .dll for inclusion in other projects
